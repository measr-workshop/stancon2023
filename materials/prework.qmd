Thank you participating in our workshop, Cognitive Diagnostic Models With R and Stan.
To prepare for the workshop, please install the following:

* A recent version of R (≥ 4.2.0), which is available for free at <https://cran.r-project.org/>
* (Recommended) A recent version of RStudio Desktop (≥ 2023.06.0-421), available for free at <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>
* The R packages we will use, which you can install by connecting to the internet, opening RStudio, and running the following code in the console:

```{.r}
install.packages(c("measr", "fs", "usethis"),
                 repos = "https://cran.rstudio.com/",
                 dependencies = TRUE)
```

## Optional

By default, measr using [rstan](https://mc-stan.org/rstan) as a backend for estimating models.
However, the version of rstan on CRAN is outdated.
Therefore, I recommend using an updated version of rstan from the [stan-dev/r-packages](https://github.com/stan-dev/r-packages) repository, or using the [cmdstanr](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr) interface to CmdStan.

### Updated rstan

You can download an updated version of rstan by running the following code:

```{.r}
install.packages(
  c("StanHeaders", "rstan"),
  repos = c("https://mc-stan.org/r-packages/", getOption("repos"))
)
```

To verify that rstan is installed correctly, run the following code.
If it works, then things are set up properly!
For additional help installing rstan, see the [RStan Getting Started](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started) help page.

```{.r}
example(stan_model, package = "rstan", run.dontrun = TRUE)
```


### cmdstanr

For cmdstanr, I recommend installing the development version directly from Github:

```{.r}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("stan-dev/cmdstanr")
```

After installing cmdstanr, you will also need to install CmdStan, which can be by running:

```{.r}
cmdstanr::install_cmdstan()
```

To ensure that cmdstanr and CmdStan are installed properly, try running the following code.
If it works, then you are good to go!
For help with install cmdstanr, see the [Getting Started with CmdStanR](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/articles/cmdstanr.html) vignette.

```{.r}
file <- file.path(cmdstan_path(), "examples", "bernoulli", "bernoulli.stan")
mod <- cmdstan_model(file)
```
